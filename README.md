#Wilson App (Name Pending)
Welcome to the Wilson App github repository! This app is coded using a typescript cordova project in visual studio. If you would like to suggest a change, please test it on master branch before submitting a pull request.
One of the goals of this project is for it to be maintainable be someone other than me, so if you are intrested in developing an app for Wilson please shoot me an email: noah@koontzs.com. Basic javascript/HTML experience is recommended.
Eventually, I will write documentation in the wiki.
